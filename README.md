# blog-website
<p>
• Grouped with 2 team members to gather information, evaluate user requirements, and create a website 
through GitHub to code with different branches resulting in a 20% reduction in merge conflicts and 
improved team collaboration.<br>
• Made an ER model for effective content management by MySQL Workbench<br>
• Enabled search and filtering features using PHP functions to run SQL DML queries. Also, the website 
allowed users to add, display, and remove content and their accounts. With PHP, we led the users to 
follow step by step to create an account or comment on a random post. Used DOM manipulation by
adding the EventListener() method to validate information on the user side dynamically and show error 
messages<br>
• Executed manual testing for the blog website project to make sure all features satisfied user needs.
